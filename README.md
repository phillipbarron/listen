# WIP sandbox for language detection


Hit to google translate / AWS Comprehend API and display results in a React component

## Disclaimer!
This is a proof-of-concept which may (does) depart from engineering excellence principles at times. The styling choices may also prove to be at odds with common notions of aesthetic desirability.

## Prerequisites
needs an `npm i` in root, server and client packages (needs lerna but this is a  test so...); it's also expecting to find an `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

## Run application

```bash
npm run start
```
